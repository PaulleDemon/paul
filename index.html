                            100+ users, we not only created the product we were also deeply involved in marketing, analysing the users behaviour
                            on our platform. Using Google analytics to market it to right people etc.
                            <br>
                            The app allowed users to quickly search for people with a specific set of skills or achievements withing the orginazation.

                            Python designer is a visual scripting tool made to help python 
                            programmers easily create classes. A user is expected to add whats called as node from right-click context-menu, which then allows users to add variables and methods. Users can draw connection between nodes to depict inheritance. Once the users is satisfied with the design, user can click on generate to generate the python equivalent code.

                            Robotic arm controller is a software that acts as an interface between, arduino that controls the robotic arm and you computer through bluetooth module. It provides a simple to use Graphical user interface, where users can add sequential
                            instructions which will then be executed in the same order. Users can 
                            additionally save the instruction by clicking on save button and later
                            load the instructions.

                            was a need for good tutorial. AWS tutorial didn't offer much help for 
                            people who had never worked with any cloud computing services and 
                            most tutorials were "do this do that" type of tutorials, which didn't
                            offer much help when you are stuck or have a need to debug.

                            This tutorial goes much deeper than just "do this do that" type of tutorial. This tutorial also talks on how to spot and debug common 
                            errors.
