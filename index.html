        <div class="content">
            I am Paul Sajo, the creator of 
            Peckwoods, a Social networking platform, 
            currently pursuing my B.tech in Computer 
            Science and Engineering at Christ University, 
            Bangalore, India. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a technology geek, 
            I am a highly motivated research-oriented
            developer. I also have authored open-source libraries and tutorials. Besides 
            programming, I also have a love for arts and have done quite a bit of 
            3d modelling using Blender, illustrations using 
            Inkscape, image editing using Gimp and UI designs using Adobe xd. When I am not working 
            on projects, I usually help other developers in the Stackoverflow community.
            <br>
            <br>
            I invariably prefer to work on new and something 
            that I have not worked with before. I want to make sure 
            I have made an impact on this world, before I leave this planet.

                            Python designer is a visual scripting tool made to help python 
                            programmers easily create classes. A user is expected to add whats called as node from right-click context-menu, which then allows users to add variables and methods. Users can draw connection between nodes to depict inheritance. Once the users is satisfied with the design, user can click on generate to generate the python equivalent code.

                            Robotic arm controller is a software that acts as an interface between, arduino that controls the robotic arm and you computer through bluetooth module. It provides a simple to use Graphical user interface, where users can add sequential
                            instructions which will then be executed in the same order. Users can 
                            additionally save the instruction by clicking on save button and later
                            load the instructions.

                            was a need for good tutorial. AWS tutorial didn't offer much help for 
                            people who had never worked with any cloud computing services and 
                            most tutorials were "do this do that" type of tutorials, which didn't
                            offer much help when you are stuck or have a need to debug.

                            This tutorial goes much deeper than just "do this do that" type of tutorial. This tutorial also talks on how to spot and debug common 
                            errors.
