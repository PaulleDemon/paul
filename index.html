        <div class="content">
            I am Paul Sajo, the creator and founder of 
            Peckwoods , a Social networking platform, 
            currently pursuing my B.tech in Computer 
            Science and Engineering at Christ University, 
            Bangalore, India. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am highly motivated research oriented senior 
            developer. I also have authored many open-source libraries and tutorials. Besides 
            programming I also have also done quite a bit of 
            3d modeling using Blender, illustrations using 
            Inkscape, image editing using Gimp and UI designs using Adobe xd. When I am not working 
            on any projects I usually help other developers in Stack overflow community.
            <br>
            <br>
            I always prefer to work on new and something 
            that I have not worked with before. I usually work 
            alone, but when I am assigned a team I prefer to 
            work in small group with highly motivated 
            people. I am also a believer of "Too many cooks 
            spoil the broth".

                            Python designer is a visual scripting tool made to help python 
                            programmers easily create classes. A user is expected to add whats called as node from right-click context-menu, which then allows users to add variables and methods. Users can draw connection between nodes to depict inheritance. Once the users is satisfied with the design, user can click on generate to generate the python equivalent code.

                            Robotic arm controller is a software that acts as an interface between, arduino that controls the robotic arm and you computer through bluetooth module. It provides a simple to use Graphical user interface, where users can add sequential
                            instructions which will then be executed in the same order. Users can 
                            additionally save the instruction by clicking on save button and later
                            load the instructions.

                            was a need for good tutorial. AWS tutorial didn't offer much help for 
                            people who had never worked with any cloud computing services and 
                            most tutorials were "do this do that" type of tutorials, which didn't
                            offer much help when you are stuck or have a need to debug.

                            This tutorial goes much deeper than just "do this do that" type of tutorial. This tutorial also talks on how to spot and debug common 
                            errors.

                            The Beginners guide to learning PyQt/PySide offers a much deeper
                            understanding of how event driven programming works. This tutorial
                            is made to help beginners and intermediate programmers to get 
                            started with Event driven programming.

                            If you haven't worked with GUI programming this is the best place to start.

            <ul>
                <p class="sub-title"> Here's somethings you need to know about me</p>
                <li>I am no expert or genius, so don't expect me to know everything.</li>
                <li>
                    All my experience is from working on real projects by myself, not from books. 
                    So I might not be aware of all the terminology.
                </li>
                <li>I always prefer to work on hard thing, things that I have not worked with before.</li>
                <li>I am always willing to learn new things to bring ideas to reality.</li>
                <li>
                    I am always curious, I cannot be told to follow instructions without telling
                    me "why". If I don't know why things work/doesn't work I experiment and I am
                    very much ok with making mistakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I very much prefer to work in a small team of highly movitated people. I
                    believe that highly motivated people don't need to be monitered often and
                    can work on hard things with a lot of faith even when things doesn't work as expected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Willing to work only under leaders with less ego and 
                    who are ready to consult the team and conduct debates before taking 
                    any major decisions.

                </li>
                <li>I cannot be told to cut my beard or my hair.</li>
                <li>Nobody in the company should interfere with the personal choices that I make in my life.</li>

            </ul>
